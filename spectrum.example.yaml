object_information_groups:
  description: The units of information in these groups are used to record aspects
    of an object or a group of objects. Some object groups are paired with a procedural

    example Object audit information records the audit information relating to an
    object while Audit information records information relating to an audit as a whole.
    The information in each group is linked to an object via the Object number.

            The Object name may be a common name or classification of an object in
            a textual or codified form. By using broader terms in a classification
            system, the object can be classified as belonging to a particular group
            or category of objects.

            An object can be named at a very specific or a very general level, eg
            mug/drinking vessel/container/domestic artefact. The same object could
            also be assigned different names depending on the context, eg mug/commemorative
            item/studio pot. For this reason it is often necessary to record more
            than one Object name.

            Use Brief description to record a sentence describing an object more fully.
            Use Title to record the name of a specific object or group of objects.
